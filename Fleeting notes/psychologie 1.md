over confidence can generate errors

getting 5 heads in a row in a coin flip does not mean youâ€™re cheating

curiosity can lead to death

doing testing without a hypothisis and research but purely out of research is bad

skepticisim without curiosty can generate questions

humility is very important 

objectiveness is needed to do research but its hard

the reseach group needs to be big enough and with great variety in order to get specific results
