OOP stabds for Object-Oriented Programming

Java is an OOP language, that means the style of the code you write in java is heavily focused on [[Classes|classes]] and objects.

Other styles of coding include procedural programming, which is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on data.

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Why use oop?</span>
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
* **OOP** is faster and easier to execute

* **OOP** provides a clear structure for the programs
* **OOP** helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
* **OOP** makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

```ad-note
The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it
```
