### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What is a blockchain</span>

A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.

The blockchain was first made mainstream by bitcoin and how it uses it as an asset. Bitcoin is sort of like digital gold and canbe seen as a form of currency.

Etherium took this idea one step further and added the ability to make decentralized applications on the blockchain using smart contracts. 

Smart contracts can interract with the external world like external data or computation using oracles with chainlink being the most powerful decentralized oracle network which allows us to build hybrid smart contracts.

A hybrid smart contract is a smart contract that combines on-blockchain computation and off-blockchain computation.

#### 1. Decentralized

Decentralized means there is no one centralized force that controls the blockchain. It is made up of many individuals.

The Individuals who make up the blockchain are called node operators and they are the independent individuals who run the blockchain.

This is important so no one single entity can control any market.		

#### 2. Transparency

Anything that happens on the blockchain can be seen by everyone so it has many eyes on it and everyone has to play by the same rules that can be seen by everyone.

The blockchain is pseudo-anonymous so you can interract with it from any differernt account.
