### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What is a blockchain</span>

A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format.

The blockchain was first made mainstream by bitcoin and how it uses it as an asset. Bitcoin is sort of like digital gold and canbe seen as a form of currency.

Etherium took this idea one step further and added the ability to make decentralized applications on the blockchain using smart contracts. 

Smart contracts can interract with the external world like external data or computation using oracles with chainlink being the most powerful decentralized oracle network which allows us to build hybrid smart contracts.

A hybrid smart contract is a smart contract that combines on-blockchain computation and off-blockchain computation.
