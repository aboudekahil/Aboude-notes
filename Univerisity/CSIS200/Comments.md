### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What are comments?</span>
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Single line comments</span>

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes `//`.

Any text between `//` and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

```ad-example
* ```java
// This is a comment
System.out.println("Hello World");
* ```java
System.out.println("Hello World"); // This is a comment
```

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;"> Multi line comments </span>
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by Java.

```ad-example
```java
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
System.out.println("Hello World");
``````
