OOP stabds for Object-Oriented Programming

Java is an OOP language, that means the style of the code you write in java is heavily focused on [[Classes|classes]] and objects.

Other styles of coding include procedural programming, which is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on data.

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Why use oop?</span>
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
* **OOP** is faster and easier to execute

* **OOP** provides a clear structure for the programs
* **OOP** helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
* **OOP** makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

```ad-note
The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it
```

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What are classes?</span>
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:
```ad-example
| Class  | Objects |
|:------:|:-------:|
| Fruits |  Apple  |
|        | Banana  |
|        |  Mango  |

```
```ad-example
title:Another example

| Class | Objects |
|:-----:|:-------:|
|  Car  |  Volvo  |
|       |  Audi   |
|       | Toyota  |
```
So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
