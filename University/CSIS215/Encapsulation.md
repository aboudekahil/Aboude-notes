### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What is encapsulation?</span>
The meaning of **Encapsulation**, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

-   declare class variables/attributes as `private`
-   provide public **get** and **set** methods to access and update the value of a `private` variable
