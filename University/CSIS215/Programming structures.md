### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What are programming structures</span>
Programming structures are types of ways you write your program in.

There are 3 types of structures: `selection`, `sequencial` and `repetition`.

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Sequencial</span>

Sequencial programming is when you do instructions one after the other in a row

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Selection</span>

Selection is when you have to choose between multiple instructions, (i.e [[If statements]])

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Repetition</span>

Repetition is when you want to do a set of instructions n-times (i.e [[Loops]])

[[If statements]] | [[Loops]]
