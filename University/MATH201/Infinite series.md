### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What are inifinite series?</span>

Infinite series are the sum of infinitely many numbers related in a given way and listed in a given order.

For an infinite series $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\cdots$, a quantity $S_n = a_1 + a_2 +\cdots+ a_n$, which involves adding only the first n terms, is called a partial sum of the series.

 If $S_n$ approaches a fixed number $S$ as $n$ becomes larger and larger, the series is said to converge. 
 
 In this case, $S$ is called the sum of the series. An infinite series that does not converge is said to diverge. In the case of divergence, no value of a sum is assigned. For example, the $n$-th partial sum of the infinite series $1 + 1 + 1 +\cdots$ is $n$. As more terms are added, the partial sum fails to approach any finite value (it grows without bound). Thus, the series diverges.
