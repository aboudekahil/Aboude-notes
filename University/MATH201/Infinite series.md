### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What are inifinite series?</span>

Infinite series are the sum of infinitely many numbers related in a given way and listed in a given order.

For an infinite series $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 +\cdots$, a quantity $S_n = a_1 + a_2 +\cdots+ a_n$, which involves adding only the first n terms, is called a partial sum of the series.
