The probability of an event $A$ is the sum of weights of sample points in $A$, given that the weught of sample space $S$ is $1$.

> $$P(\emptyset)=0,\,P(S)=1,\,0\leq P(A) \leq 1$$

If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are mutually exclusive

> $$P(A_1 \cup A_2)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)$$
> $$P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
