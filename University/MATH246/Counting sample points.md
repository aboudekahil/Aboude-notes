### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Multiplication rule</span>

If a first operation can be performed in $n_1$ ways and a second experiment can be performed in $n_2$, the two experiments can be performed together in $n_1 \times n_2$ ways

```ad-note
title: special case

if an axperiment resulting in $n$ out comes is repeated $p$ times, the obtained number of outcomes is: 
> $$n^p$$
```

```ad-example
If a pair of dice is thrown 1 time, the number of outcomes is 
> $$6 \times 6 = 6^2$$
```
