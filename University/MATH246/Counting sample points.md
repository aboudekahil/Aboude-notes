### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Multiplication rule</span>

If a first operation can be performed in $n_1$ ways and a second experiment can be performed in $n_2$, the two experiments can be performed together in $n_1 \times n_2$ ways

```ad-note
title: special case

if an axperiment resulting in $n$ out comes is repeated $p$ times, the obtained number of outcomes is: 
> $$n^p$$
```
___
```ad-example
title: Example 1
If a pair of dice is thrown $1$ time, the number of outcomes is 
> $$6 \times 6 = 6^2$$
```
```ad-example
title: Example 2
if a student must choose $2$ courses, one from a selection of $4$ and the other from a selection of $2$ then the number of possible outcomes is
> $$4 \times 2 = 8$$
```
```ad-example
title: Example 3
How many even, four digit numbers: $(0,1,2,5,6,9)$ where each digit can only be used once?

first of all we need to look at the number of the conditions put at our number:
	1. the number has to be 4 digits
	2. the first number cannot be 0
```

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Permutation</span>
It’s the number of ways of permuting $n$ distinct objects (with order):

> $$n!$$

### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">Circle permutation</span>
It’s the number of ways of permuting $n$ distinct objects in a closed path:
> $$(n-1)!$$
