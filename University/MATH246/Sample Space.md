It’s the set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment.

More than one sample space can be used to describe the outcomes of an experiment, and sample spaces with a large or infinite number of sample points are described by a statement or rule. 

Each outcome in a sample space is called an element or member of the sample space or simply a sample point.

```ad-example
title: Example 1
The sample space of tossing a coin is

> $$ S = \{ \text{heads, tails} \} $$
```
```ad-example
title: Example 2
The sample space of all the points on the interior of a circle with a radius of 2 and centered at the origin is

> $$ S = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } x^2 + y^2 < 2^2 \}$$

**NOTE**: $S$ is uncountable
