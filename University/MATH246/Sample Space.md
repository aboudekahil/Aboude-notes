### <span style="color: #ff5545;text-transform: capitalize;">What’s a sample space?</span>
It’s the set of all possible outcomes of a statistical experiment.

More than one sample space can be used to describe the outcomes of an experiment, and sample spaces with a large or infinite number of sample points are described by a statement or rule. 

Each outcome in a sample space is called an element or member of the sample space or simply a sample point.

```ad-example
The sample space of tossing a coin is

> $$S=\bigg{\text{heads, tails}\big}$$
```
